# PSoC Creator project for Metropolia PSoC-Zumo adapter

In this C programming course we had to program a robot. For the final project we as a team had to program the robot to do 3 tasks:

1) [Stay inside the course and avoid the central obstacle (Xiaoming Ma)](https://github.com/chmromano/smartDevicesProject/blob/master/ZumoBot.cydsn/alex.c)

2) [Follow a circuit and get to the finish line (Giang Vu)](https://github.com/chmromano/smartDevicesProject/blob/master/ZumoBot.cydsn/giang.c)

3) [Navigate a maze until the end (Christopher Romano)](https://github.com/chmromano/smartDevicesProject/blob/master/ZumoBot.cydsn/chris.c)
