# PSoC Creator project for Metropolia PSoC-Zumo adapter

In this C programming course we had to program a robot. For the final project we as a team had to program the robot to do 3 tasks:

1) Stay inside the course and avoid the central obstacle (Xiaoming Ma)

2) Follow a circuit and get to the finish line (Giang Vu)

3) Navigate a maze until the end (Christopher Romano)
